## Call Structure

### [0-5 min] INTRO & RAPPORT

**Script:**
> "Hey [Name], thanks for jumping on. Before we dive into the numbers, I just want to get a quick feel for where you're at right now. How's business been the last few weeks?"

*Let them talk. Listen for pain points.*

> "Perfect. So here's how we'll run this - I'm going to share my screen and walk you through everything we found. Stop me anytime if something doesn't make sense or you want to dig deeper. Sound good?"

---

### [5-20 min] DISCOVERY - Understanding Their Reality

These questions go DEEPER than the onboarding form. You're looking for the emotional truth.

**Business Reality:**
- "Walk me through a typical week for you - from Monday morning to Friday knock-off"
- "What does a good month look like vs a bad month?"
- "When was the last time you felt really stressed about the business?"

**Money Mindset:**
- "How do you decide what to charge?"
- "When's the last time you raised your prices? How did it go?"
- "Do you ever feel awkward talking about money with customers?"

**Growth Blockers:**
- "What's stopping you from hitting [their stated goal]?"
- "If I gave you 10 more hours a week, what would you do with them?"
- "What have you tried before that didn't work?"

**The Magic Question:**
> "If we're talking again in 12 months and you say 'that was the best decision I ever made' - what changed?"

*Write down their exact words. This is gold for tailoring advice AND for building agents.*

---

### [20-50 min] REPORT WALKTHROUGH

Share screen, walk through the report section by section.

**Key principle: Translate numbers to THEIR reality**

**Don't say:** "Your pricing gap is 18%"

**Say:** "You're charging $95/hr but the market is $115. On 40 billable hours/week, that's $800/week you're leaving on the table - $41k/year."

**Don't say:** "Your quote conversion is 23%"

**Say:** "You're sending 20 quotes a month but only winning 4-5. If we get that to 8-10, that's an extra $15-20k/month without finding a single new lead."

**For each major finding, ask:**
1. "Does this match what you're seeing?"
2. "Why do you think this is happening?"
3. "What have you tried to fix this?"

**Sections to cover:**
1. Executive Summary - their headline number
2. Pricing Audit - market comparison
3. Best & Worst Jobs - where money is made/lost
4. Customer Analysis - A/B/C grades
5. Online Presence Score - Google situation
6. Quoting Process - time/speed analysis
7. Operations Efficiency - admin burden
8. Action Plan - 90-day priorities

---

### [50-75 min] PROVEN TECHNIQUES

Pick 2-3 techniques that fit their situation. Give them the exact scripts.

---

#### Technique 1: The Price Confidence Script
**When to use:** They're undercharging, scared to raise prices

**Tell them:**
> "Here's what I want you to say to your next 5 customers:
>
> 'Just so you know, our rates are going up next month. If you book now, I can lock you in at the current rate.'
>
> This does 3 things:
> 1. Tests the market - do they push back?
> 2. Creates urgency - book now
> 3. Gives you permission to raise prices - you announced it
>
> If 0 out of 5 push back → raise prices immediately
> If 1-2 push back → raise prices, you'll lose some, gain margin
> If 4-5 push back → your service needs improvement first"

---

#### Technique 2: The 48-Hour Quote Rule
**When to use:** Slow quoting, low conversion

**Tell them:**
> "From now on, every quote goes out within 48 hours. Here's why:
>
> - Day 1: Customer is excited, comparing 2-3 tradies
> - Day 3: Customer has picked someone, you're too late
> - Day 7: Customer forgot about the job entirely
>
> Speed = trust. The fast tradie gets the job.
>
> **Action:** Set a phone alarm for 6pm every day. If you have unsent quotes, they go out before dinner."

---

#### Technique 3: The Review Machine
**When to use:** Low Google reviews, weak online presence

**Tell them:**
> "You need 30 reviews in 90 days. Here's the system:
>
> 1. After EVERY job, before you leave the site:
>    'Hey mate, if you're happy with the work, would you mind leaving a quick Google review? It really helps.'
>
> 2. Send a text within 2 hours:
>    'Thanks again [name]! If you have 30 seconds, a Google review would mean the world: [link]'
>
> 3. Track it: 10 jobs = 3-4 reviews (30% response rate is normal)
>
> You do 40 jobs/month → 12 reviews/month → 30 reviews in 10 weeks"

**Give them this template:**
```
Thanks again [Name]! Really appreciate the work.

If you've got 30 secs, a quick Google review would be awesome - helps other people find us.

[Direct Google review link]

Cheers,
[Your name]
```

---

#### Technique 4: The Call-Out Fee Anchor
**When to use:** No call-out fee, underpricing small jobs

**Tell them:**
> "Small jobs are killing your profit. Here's the fix:
>
> Add a $95 call-out fee to every quote.
>
> 'Just to let you know, there's a $95 call-out which covers my travel and the first 30 minutes on site. After that, it's $X per hour.'
>
> What happens:
> - Some say no → good, those jobs lose you money anyway
> - Most say yes → you just made $95 for showing up
> - It filters out tyre-kickers who waste your time"

---

#### Technique 5: The Follow-Up System
**When to use:** No follow-up, losing warm leads

**Tell them:**
> "You're losing 40% of your quotes because you don't follow up.
>
> Here's the system:
> - Day 1: Send quote
> - Day 3: Text 'Hey [name], just checking you got my quote. Any questions?'
> - Day 7: Call (yes, actually call)
> - Day 14: Final text 'Still keen? Happy to adjust if needed.'
>
> Track everything in a simple spreadsheet:
> Name | Quote Date | Follow-up 1 | Follow-up 2 | Result
>
> Most tradies don't follow up. You doing it = instant advantage."

---

#### Technique 6: The 80/20 Customer Audit
**When to use:** Busy but not profitable, some customers drain them

**Tell them:**
> "Let's find your best and worst customers.
>
> Pull your last 20 jobs. For each one, score:
> - Profit margin (high/medium/low)
> - Hassle factor (easy/normal/nightmare)
> - Payment speed (fast/normal/slow)
>
> You'll find:
> - 4-5 customers who are gold (high profit, easy, fast pay)
> - 4-5 customers who are poison (low profit, nightmare, slow)
>
> **Action:** Fire the bottom 20%.
> Say: 'We're fully booked and focusing on existing customers.'
>
> Then: Ask your top 20% for referrals. Their friends are probably just like them."

---

#### Technique 7: The Same-Day Invoice Rule
**When to use:** Cash flow problems, slow to invoice

**Tell them:**
> "Invoice before you leave the job site. Every time.
>
> Use your phone - Xero, MYOB, even just an email template.
>
> Why:
> - Fresh in the customer's mind
> - They can't dispute 'I didn't get the invoice'
> - You get paid 7-14 days faster on average
>
> 14 days faster × 40 jobs/year × average job size = $X sitting in YOUR account instead of theirs."

---

### [75-90 min] ACTION PLAN

**Don't overwhelm them.** Pick 3 things max.

**Framework:**
> "Based on everything we've talked about, here are your 3 priorities:
>
> **WEEK 1-2: [Quick Win]**
> - Specific action
> - Expected result
> - Time required
>
> **WEEK 3-4: [Medium Effort]**
> - Specific action
> - Expected result
> - Time required
>
> **WEEK 5-8: [Strategic Change]**
> - Specific action
> - Expected result
> - Time required
>
> If you do just these 3 things, you'll [specific outcome].
>
> Which one feels most doable to start?"

**End with accountability:**
- "Can I check in with you in 2 weeks to see how the first one went?"
- "What might get in the way of you doing this?"
- "Who else needs to know about this plan?"

---

### CLOSE (Final 5 min)

> "Any other questions before we wrap up?"

> "I'll send you the full report and a recording of this call within 24 hours. You can reference it anytime."

> "I'll check in via email in 2 weeks to see how you're going with [first action]."

**Soft plant for agents:**
> "By the way, we're building some tools to automate [their biggest pain point - e.g., quoting, follow-ups]. When that's ready, you'll be first to know. No pressure, just wanted you to know it's coming."

---

## Post-Call Tasks

```
□ Send report + call recording within 24 hours
□ Add to CRM with key notes
□ Set 2-week follow-up reminder
□ Log their pain points for agent development
□ Ask for referral (if appropriate)
```

---

## Key Objection Handlers

### "I've tried raising prices before and lost customers"

> "How many did you lose? And how many stayed? Usually it's 1-2 out of 10, and the ones who left were probably your lowest-margin jobs anyway. The ones who stay are your A-grade customers - they're buying YOU, not just a price."

### "I don't have time for this"

> "I hear you. But here's the thing - you're working 50+ hours already. The question isn't 'do I have time?' It's 'what can I stop doing that's not making me money?' That's what we're figuring out here."

### "I'm not good with tech/software"

> "Neither are most tradies. But your kids or your partner probably are, right? Or you can hire a bookkeeper for $50/week to handle this stuff. The numbers say it's worth it."

### "My customers won't pay more"

> "Some won't. And that's fine - they're probably not your best customers anyway. The question is: are you building a business around your best customers, or around the ones who shop on price?"

### "What if this doesn't work?"

> "That's a fair question. Here's what I can tell you: these aren't fancy strategies. They're things that work for thousands of tradies. The only way they don't work is if you don't do them. And even if you only do one thing from today's call, you'll be ahead."
