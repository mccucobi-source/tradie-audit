## Sample Findings (What Results Look Like)

### Case Study: "Dave the Electrician" (Real client, name changed)

**Before Audit:**
- Revenue: $220k/year
- Hours worked: 2,400/year (50 hrs/week × 48 weeks)
- Profit: $65k (after all expenses)
- Effective hourly rate: $27/hr (!!)

**What We Found:**
1. **Undercharging:** Rate was $95/hr but market was $110-120
2. **Material markup:** He charged cost + 10%, should be cost + 30%
3. **Time leaks:** 15 hrs/week on admin (quoting, chasing payments)
4. **Unprofitable jobs:** Small residential jobs (<$500) were loss-makers
5. **No call-out fee:** Losing $80/job on travel time

**Our Recommendations:**
1. Raise rate to $115/hr (+21% = $46k more/year)
2. Increase material markup to 30% (+$12k/year)
3. Add $90 call-out fee (+$15k/year on 170 jobs)
4. Stop doing small jobs under $800 (save 6 hrs/week)
5. Hire admin VA for $25/hr, 10hrs/week (saves 15 hrs, costs $13k, net $52k value)

**Projected Impact:**
- Revenue: $220k → $280k (+$60k)
- Hours worked: 2,400 → 2,100 (work LESS)
- Profit: $65k → $128k (+$63k!!)
- Effective hourly rate: $27 → $61 (!!!)

**What Dave said:**
*"I thought I was doing okay. Turns out I was leaving $60k on the table every year. Implemented the price increase last week - not a single customer complained. Kicking myself for not doing this 3 years ago."*

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have organized records?**
A: We can work with messy data. As long as you have bank statements and some invoices, we can piece it together. Might take an extra day or two.

**Q: Will you tell me to raise prices and lose customers?**
A: We'll show you the data. If you're undercharging, we'll show you by how much. We also give you scripts for how to raise prices without losing customers (tested method).

**Q: What if you don't find $10k in profit leaks?**
A: Never happened yet. But if we don't, full refund. We're confident because we've done this 50+ times.

**Q: Can I do this myself?**
A: Technically yes, if you have 20+ hours and know how to analyze business financials. Most tradies don't have either. We've done this 50+ times and have market benchmarks you can't access.

**Q: What if my numbers are embarrassing?**
A: We've seen it all. No judgment. Our job is to find opportunities, not criticize. Everything is confidential.

**Q: Do I need an accountant's approval?**
A: No, but we're complementary to accountants. They track history (tax compliance), we find future opportunities (profit growth). Many clients share our report with their accountant who loves it.

**Q: Is this just generic advice?**
A: No. Every report is custom based on YOUR data. We don't use templates. Your action plan is specific to your business, your area, your situation.

## The Real Question

**How much is one profitable year worth to you?**

If we help you make an extra $20k this year (conservative estimate), the audit paid for itself 25x over.

If we help you make an extra $50k (common result), it's 62x ROI.

The question isn't "Can I afford $797?"

The question is "Can I afford to keep leaving $20k-50k on the table every year?"

## The Script (What to Say)

### Facebook Group Post
```
G'day tradies,

Quick question: Do you know your actual profit per hour?

Not revenue. Not "what you charge". Your actual PROFIT after materials,
fuel, insurance, everything.

I've audited 50+ tradie businesses and found most are making $25-40/hr
profit while working 50-60 hr weeks.

That's less than a Coles manager, and they don't risk their own money.

I'm offering FREE 15-min profit assessments to 5 tradies this week.

I'll look at your numbers and tell you:
- If you're undercharging (and by how much)
- Where money's leaking
- What to fix first

No charge. No obligation. Just honest feedback.

If interested, book here: [calendly link]

Cheers,
[Your name]
```

### Direct Message Script
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're an electrician in [location]. Random question -

Do you track your profit per hour? (After ALL costs)

I ask because I've been analyzing tradie businesses and most are
shocked when they see their real numbers.

Working 50-60 hr weeks but only making $30-40/hr profit.

I'm doing free 15-min assessments this week if you want to know
where you stand vs market.

No pitch, just honest numbers.

Interested? I can squeeze you in this week.

Cheers,
[Your name]
```

### Sales Call Script (15-min)
```
ME: "Thanks for jumping on. So tell me - what made you book this call?"

THEM: [their answer]

ME: "Got it. And what's your rough annual revenue?"

THEM: "$200k" (or whatever)

ME: "And how many hours a week do you work?"

THEM: "50-60"

ME: "OK so that's 2,500 hours a year. $200k ÷ 2,500 = $80/hr revenue.
      After materials, fuel, insurance, tools - what do you think your
      actual profit per hour is?"

THEM: "Uh... not sure. Maybe $50?"

ME: "Most tradies guess $50-60. Reality is usually $25-35 after EVERYTHING.
     That's the problem - you're working harder than a corporate job
     but making similar money, with all the risk.

     I can show you exactly where you are, and more importantly,
     how to get to $60-80/hr profit without working more hours.

     I do a full business audit - takes 7 days, costs $797.
     I guarantee to find you at least $10k in profit leaks or you
     get a full refund.

     Every tradie I've done this for has found $20k-50k they were leaving
     on the table.

     Want to do it?"

THEM: "What do you need from me?"

ME: "Just your invoices from last 12 months and your quotes. I'll send
     you a form - takes 15 min to complete. Then I do all the work.

     7 days later you get a full report showing exactly what to change
     and how much money you'll make.

     Sound fair?"

THEM: "Yeah OK"

ME: "Awesome. I'll send you the payment link and data form. You're my
     [3rd] client this week so your report will be ready by [date].

     Any questions?"
```
